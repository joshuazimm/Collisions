This is a collision simulation that places circular particles in a circle that have applied gravity. These circles collide with continuous circular walls creating really cool symmetrical shapes as well as being a good demonstrator of floating point errors. This was done in C++ using SDL2 for the visualization itself.
Compile Line: g++ -std=c++17 multi.cpp -o (out) -lSDL2 -ldl
Works with most recent version of SDL2
